## Introduction

This project showcases a machine learning workflow using a dataset related to team performance. The key steps include:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Result visualization

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_Project.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the data analysis and model results.

## Project Structure

- `ML_Project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning workflow.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis (not included in the repository, please add your own dataset).
